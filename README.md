# The-Big-Apple-Filming-Trail

New York City is considered one of the greatest cities in the whole world having a cinematic identity that touches upon all walks of life. Some of the most iconic movies, television series, documentaries, short films, dramas, theatres, etc. have all revolved around this bustling metropolis. Being a movie buff for ages, specially a NYC romcom fan (which I’m sure many of us are) and an immigrant who grew up listening to stories and learning about NYC from a distance through different entertainment mediums, it was an exciting idea of finally getting an opportunity to analyze the statistics and probably maximize the chances of stumbling upon on a random shoot. (Question like where to go?). This was made possible by the data hosted at the NYC Open Data portal  .

NYC Open Data portal provides details regarding filming data permits for various NYC locations for the period between 2014 – 2019 (~42K records). Typically permits are required when asserting the exclusive use of city property, like a sidewalk, a street, or a park  . The Office of Film, Theatre, and Broadcasting issues permits to productions filming on location in the City of New York and provides free police assistance, free parking privileges and access to most exterior locations free of charge. We have the following details in hand for analysis: 

•	Event Type – Type of event (Theatre Load In, Load Out, Shooting, Rigging, DCAS Permit, etc.)
•	Start Date – Activity scheduled to begin (MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS AM/PM)
•	End Date – Activity scheduled to be completed (MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS AM/PM)
•	Entered Date – Permit request submission date (MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS AM/PM) 
•	Parking Locations – Locations of request to hold parking in advance for permitted filming activity.
•	Borough – First borough of activity for the day
•	Category – Commercial, Documentary, Film, Music Video etc.
•	Subcategory – More specific description of production as selected by the permit applicant
•	Zip Codes – First zip code of production activity
•	Country of project origin – Domestic or International

Several interesting insights can be gathered by effectively visualizing this data. Thanks to the proliferation of social media, people are always on the hunt for “Instagrammable” locations specially in a place like NYC. By visual analysis, we should be able to come up with interesting statistics which can be used for generating tourist attraction or help local residents anticipate chaos during peak time, the possibilities are endless.
